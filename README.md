## üåç About the app

Astro Baba is an astrology mobile application made with **React Native**. Uses **Expo** as a toolchain and **Paper** for styling and theming.

Is only published in Android, as Apple is not accepting more Astrology apps, but works for both platforms.


## üîß Run it yourself
The app uses Expo for bootstrapping and as develop environment. To get started, first install the dependencies:
```bash
$ yarn || npm install
```
Then run Expo:
```bash
$ expo start
```
Then you can use your own mobile device to run the app or use an Android/iOS emulator. Yes, Expo is amazing.

- Check your **daily horoscope**, that includes focus of the day, lucky numbers and compatibility.
- Check **compatibility** with other signs.
- **Learn more** about astrology and the zodiac.
- Ask **questions** to our own non AI Astrologers.
